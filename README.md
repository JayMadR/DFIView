# DFIView

I wanted to make a small excel sheet which gives a nice overview of whats going on on the DeFi-Blockchain and how my portfolio is performing.
Well, it got "a little" bigger than expected...

So I decided to share this with you guys!

All you have to do:
1) add your address (on the tab "Data1" in cell "C3" and below) - you can also set a name for each address
2) switch to the tab "myLT", choose your address (dropdown on cell "B4") and click on update

feel free to suggest modifications

cheers
